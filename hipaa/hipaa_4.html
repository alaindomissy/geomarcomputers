    <td><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>HIPAA 
        Compliance</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The various HIPAA 
        regulations will take effect at different times depending on when the 
        final rules are adopted for each. Generally speaking, affected entities 
        have until October 16, 2003 to comply. (See the detailed chart below) 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Health care providers, 
        clearinghouses, and their business associates have significant changes 
        that must be put into place prior to the compliance dates stated in the 
        HIPAA regulations. </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>We 
        recommend completing a thorough HIPAA Readiness assessment as soon as 
        possible, to meet the upcoming deadline of October 16, 2003.</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>April 14, 
        2003:</strong> Compliance testing commences for Privacy standards for 
        all covered entities except small health plans. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>October 16, 
        2003:</strong> Compliance deadline for Transaction and Code Sets. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>April 14, 
        2004:</strong> Compliance deadline for Privacy standards for small health 
        plans with less than $5 million in annual receipts.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Enforcement</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the first 
        promises made by the DHHS Secretary Tommy Thompson after the publication 
        of the Final Rule on the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable 
        Health Information (the &quot;Privacy Rule&quot;) was that HHS would quickly 
        follow up with guidance on the interpretation of the rule. The first guidance 
        document (the &quot;July 6 Guidance&quot;) was published by the HHS Office 
        of Civil Rights (&quot;OCR&quot;), the primary Privacy Rule enforcement 
        office, on July 6, 2001.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
        has been some concern expressed that DHHS would require a dramatic, very 
        expensive re-engineering of health care processes, procedures and facilities. 
        Some of these expressions of concern may have been politically motivated, 
        but there have also been many legitimate questions. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The July 
        6 Guidance should serve to allay some of these concerns, as it suggests 
        there will be amendments to the Privacy Rule which will accommodate a 
        number of common situations in realistic ways which recognize the need 
        to accommodate established practices. It also provides some interpretation 
        of the ways the Privacy Rule will be officially interpreted in some situations, 
        which may not result in amendments to the regulation but may be helpful 
        in resolving ambiguities and filling gaps in the application of the rule.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Penalties 
        for non-compliance</strong></font><br>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Organizations that 
        fail to comply with HIPAA can incur civil penalties that include $100 
        for each violation, up to a maximum of $25,000 for violating a particular 
        requirement of the law. Keep in mind that a global release of information 
        on multiple employees would likely trigger the $100 penalty for each employee 
        - so it won't be difficult to hit the maximum penalty with a single incident.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But civil 
        penalties under HIPAA are just the beginning. The law also stipulates 
        criminal penalties, ranging from $50,000 and one year in federal prison 
        for wrongful disclosure, up to $250,000 and ten years in prison for a 
        deliberate offense with intent to sell protected health information. This 
        may be the first law in U.S. history where handing out information can 
        land you in jail. Recognizing that the sweeping changes required by HIPAA 
        will take time to implement, the law sets an effective date for compliance 
        - and penalties.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Criminal 
        and civil penalties aside, bad press and litigation could be more damaging.</font><br>
