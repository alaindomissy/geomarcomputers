        Background &amp; History</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There have been numerous 
        federal initiatives aimed at protecting the privacy of sensitive personal 
        information over the past several decades. In 1965, the House of Representatives 
        created a Special Subcommittee on Invasion of Privacy. In 1973, this Department's 
        predecessor agency, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare issued 
        &quot;The Code of Fair Information Practice Principles&quot; establishing 
        an important baseline for information privacy in the U.S. These principles 
        formed the basis for the federal Privacy Act of 1974, which: regulates 
        the government's use of personal information by limiting the disclosure 
        of personally-identifiable information, allows consumers access to information 
        about them, requires federal agencies to specify the purposes for collecting 
        personal information, and provides civil and criminal penalties for misuse 
        of information.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1997, a Presidential 
        advisory commission, the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and 
        Quality in the Health Care Industry, recognized the need for patient privacy 
        protection in its recommendations for a Consumer Bill of Rights and Responsibilities 
        (November 1997). In 1997, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget Act (Public 
        Law 105-34), which added language to the Social Security Act (18 U.S.C. 
        1852) to require Medicare to establish safeguards for the privacy of individually 
        identifiable patient information. Similarly, the Veterans Benefits section 
        of the U.S. Code provides for confidentiality of medical records in cases 
        involving drug abuse, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, HIV infection, or sickle 
        cell anemia (38 U.S.C. 7332). </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the early 1990s, 
        the Bush Administration called a group of healthcare industry leaders 
        together to discuss how healthcare administrative costs could be reduced. 
        This group concluded that this could be done best by increasing the use 
        of electronic data interchange (EDI) within the industry. This advisory 
        group later organized as the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange 
        (WEDI), which was initially co-chaired by the Presidents of the Blue Cross 
        and Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) and the Health Insurance Association 
        of America (HIAA), which represents commercial insurers. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WEDI conducted a number 
        of studies to determine how this might be accomplished, and eventually 
        recommended that Federal legislation be passed to ensure that a consistent 
        set of standards could be used across all states. Many of WEDI's recommendations 
        were included in the Clinton Health Plan, which failed to pass, and similar 
        provisions were included in other draft legislation. The Health Insurance 
        Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was finally signed into law 
        by President Clinton on August 21, 1996. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Act called on 
        Congress to enact a medical privacy statute and asked the Secretary of 
        Health and Human Services to provide Congress with recommendations for 
        protecting the confidentiality of healthcare information. The Congress 
        further recognized the importance of such standards by providing the Secretary 
        with authority to promulgate regulations on health care privacy in the 
        event that lawmakers were unable to act within the allotted three years. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the standards 
        adoption process, the DHHS consulted with the National Uniform Claims 
        Committee (NUCC), the National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC), the American 
        Dental Association, and the WEDI. DHHS also received and considered advice 
        from the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) and 
        representatives of the healthcare industry who testified before the subcommittee. 
        The end result was the adoption of the ASC ANSI X12N standards version 
        4010 for all transactions with the sole exception of pharmacy claims. 
        The standards maintained by the National Council for Prescription Drug 
        Programs (NCPDP) are already in widespread use as far as the pharmacy 
        claims are concerned and hence were selected as the de facto HIPAA standard 
        for pharmacy claims. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In keeping with the 
        mandate, the DHHS submitted recommendations to Congress on the Privacy 
        Standards on September 11, 1997, and when legislation was not enacted 
        by the deadline, issued a draft regulation on November 3, 1999 and final 
        regulation on December 28, 2000. This is the second of nine final regulations 
        (rules) to be issued. The first was the Standards for Electronic Transactions, 
        issued on August 17, 2000. The final HIPAA privacy rule was published 
        in the Federal Register on December 28, 2000. The remaining regulations 
        were passed throughout 2001 and 2002, with compliance dates in 2003, and 
        the last deadline in 2004 for the Privacy rules.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Here is the 
        timeline:</strong><br>
        <strong>August 21, 1996:</strong> Congress enacted the Health Insurance 
        Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA.) It required the Secretary

        information by February 21, 2000. </font></p>
