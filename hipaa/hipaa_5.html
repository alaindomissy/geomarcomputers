        FAQ</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What is HIPAA?</strong><br>
        The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Put off and delayed, 
        some might even say ignored due to the healthcare's recent focus on Y2K, 
        the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or HIPAA, has 
        now achieved critical status for the industry. Healthcare organizations 
        have just a few more months to comply with rules that will fundamentally 
        affect many of the ways healthcare conducts its business.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Health 
        Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or HIPAA will:</strong><br>
        Change the way healthcare organizations exchange electronic health care 
        data; <br>
        Establish new standards for </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1) administrative 
          health care transactions, <br>
          (2) procedure and diagnosis coding and <br>
          (3) identification numbers for providers, insurers and individuals; 
          <br>
          Create new security rules to ensure the safety and privacy of individually 
          identifiable healthcare information and records</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who must comply 
        with the Electronic Signature standard?</strong><br>
        Any healthcare provider, health care clearinghouse, or health plan that 
        employs an electronic signature in the transmission of one of the transactions 
        adopted under HIPAA. The electronic signature standard applies only to 
        the transactions adopted under HIPAA.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Do security 
        requirements apply only to the transactions adopted under HIPAA?</strong><br>
        No. The security standard applies to all individual health information 
        that is maintained or transmitted. This is much broader than the specific 
        transactions currently defined in the law.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Do the Security 
        Standards apply to paper documents?</strong><br>
        The most significant change from the proposed regulations is that they 
        now extend to all individual identifiable health information in the hands 
        of covered entities, regardless of whether the information is or has been 
        in electronic form. This includes purely paper records and oral communications.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Does the Security 
        Standard require use of specific technologies?</strong><br>
        No. The Security Standard is &quot;technologically neutral&quot; in order 
        to facilitate use of the latest and most promising technologies that meet 
        the needs of different healthcare organizations. The security standard 
        is a compendium of security requirements that must be satisfied. While 
        all organizations will be required to meet the basic requirements, particular 
        solutions will likely vary based upon organizational size and complexity.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How will smaller 
        providers be affected?</strong><br>
        The proposed security standard does not require extraordinary measures. 
        It involves taking actions that assure the security of the information 
        to be protected. The standard does not dictate specific technologies. 
        The requirements of the standard may be implemented in a number of ways, 
        depending upon the security needs and technologies in place at each business 
        and upon agreements among businesses that work together.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What are the 
        required timelines for achieving compliance with HIPAA regulations?</strong><br>
        According to HHS rules, the implementation deadline will be two years 
        and two months after the final HIPA regulations are released.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What benefits 
        do the new HIPAA regulations provide to healthcare organizations?</strong><br>
        There are at least three important potential benefits:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The standardization 
          of electronic data interchange may significantly improve information 
          transfer between payer and provider. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Codification of 
          electronic data standards may position providers to efficiently move 
          their services onto the Internet </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It provides healthcare 
          organizations with an opportunity to streamline and simplify their operations 
          and infrastructure thereby providing a significant potential for savings. 
          For example, a large amount of physician practice time is currently 
          spent on administrative processing. We expect that administrative needs 
          may significantly decrease with implementation of HIPAA standards.<br>
