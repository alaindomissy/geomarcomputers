  <tr> 
    <td><p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Who 
        is Affected by the HIPAA Program?</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>&quot;...any health 
        plan, any healthcare clearinghouse, and any healthcare provider that transmits 
        any health information in electronic form in connection with the defined 
        transaction.&quot;</em></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Accordingly, the following 
        entities are impacted, either as a covered entity or through business 
        associate relationship with the covered entity (please refer below for 
        the definitions): </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Healthcare 
          Providers:</strong> Hospitals, IDNs, Nursing homes, Home health agencies, 
          Pharmacies, and any licensed healthcare practitioner.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Health 
          Plans:</strong> Managed Care Organizations, HMOS and any other qualified 
          Health plans, ERISA, Medicare, and Medicaid. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Clearinghouses:</strong> 
          Billing services, Re-pricing agencies, Third-party administrators Others: 
          Public health agencies, employers, life insurers, universities, health 
          web sites, and health information systems vendors. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Covered 
          Entities:</strong> Health Plans, Healthcare Clearinghouses, and Healthcare 
          Providers who transmit any health information in electronic form in 
          connection with a transaction referred to in section 1173(a)(1) of HIPAA. 
          Healthcare providers who do not submit HIPAA transactions in standard 
          form cannot, however, skirt the requirements of HIPAA. Such providers 
          become covered by this rule when other entities, such as a billing service 
          or hospital, transmit standard electronic transactions on their behalf.</font></li>
        <li><strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Business 
          Associate:</font></strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          A person to whom the Covered Entity discloses protected health information 
          (PHI) so the person can carry out, assist with the performance of, or 
          perform on behalf of, a function or activity for the Covered Entity. 
          Business Associate includes contractors or other persons who receive 
          PHI from the Covered Entity for the purposes described above, including 
          lawyers, auditors, consultants, third-party administrators, healthcare 
          clearinghouses, data processing firms, billing firms and other Covered 
          Entities. Business Associate excludes persons who are within the Covered 
          Entity's workforce. A business association occurs when the right to 
          use or disclose PHI belongs to the Covered Entity, and another person 
          is using or disclosing the PHI to perform a function or activity on 
          behalf of the Covered Entity. Providing specified services (legal, actuarial, 
          accounting, consulting, management, accreditation, data aggregation, 
          and financial services) to a Covered Entity creates a Business Associate 
          relationship if the provision of the service involves the disclosure 
          of PHI to the service provider.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Protected 
          Health Information (PHI):</strong> encompasses all individually identifiable 
          health information transmitted or maintained by a covered entity, regardless 
          of form. This includes individually identifiable health information 
          that is transmitted by electronic media, maintained in any medium described 
          in the definition of electronic media and transmitted or maintained 
          in any other form or medium. The final rule also removed the exception 
          for individually identifiable health information of inmates of correctional 
          facilities and detainees in detention facilities.<br>
